###John's ASP.NET Core Boilerplate 2.0 w/ SSR React & ReSub

Just a simple implementation of the default React template, there has been some minor changes and tailoring to my liking.

/ClientApp is where you have the client-side TypeScript and React code.
/Controllers are where the merged controllers are

there will be a locked dependency installation in npm-shrinkwrap.json, delete it and adjust package.json to your liking if you want.

Startup.cs remains untouched, there may be adjustments in the future.

Future[?] goals
- Implement some unit tests end-to-end.
- Flesh out ReSub state management examples or just use Redux.
- Implement ideas surrounding software design patterns such as DDD, repository or factory pattern.
